Hello there !
I'm a regular contributor on the [Flarum Discuss](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/clarkwinkelmann) community forum and have contributed to multiple [Flagrow](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/1832-flagrow-nurturing-exquisite-extensions) extensions.
I've been working with Flarum since beta 6.

As well as contributing to the community and releasing open-source extensions, I offer some professional services:

(Please note these services are not affiliated with the Flarum, Gravure or Flagrow teams)

Services summary (click to go to its section below):

- [Flarum database migration](#flarum-database-migration)
- [Extension development](#extension-development)
- [General help](#general-help)

## Flarum database migration

Due to my limited availability, the migration service is currently on hold.

I'm working on an automated version of the service that I hope to release in 2019.

## Extension development

The extension you desperately need does not exist yet ?
Let's create it.

I usually work for a fixed price based on the the requirements we have to set in advance.
If you want me to improve an existing extension or expect a lot of changes in the near future, I also offer an hourly rate.

Email me a description of your project so I can see if it's something I can do and whether it fits my schedule.
I can then offer you an estimate.

## General help

I often help people free of charge via [Flarum Discuss](https://discuss.flarum.org/) or the [Flagrow Discord](https://flagrow.io/chat).
No need to mention me, other qualified people will help you there as well.

If you're looking for custom guidance on large projects, please get in touch.
