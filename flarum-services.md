Hello there !
I am a [Flarum Core developer](https://github.com/orgs/flarum/people), [FriendsOfFlarum member](https://friendsofflarum.org/members), regular contributor on the [official forums](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/clarkwinkelmann) community forum and have created many open-source and private extensions of my own.
I've been working with Flarum since beta 6 in 2017.

In addition to my open-source/volunteer contributions, I offer some professional services.

Those services are offered by myself as a freelancer and have no affiliation with the Flarum Foundation.

## Extension development

The extension you desperately need does not exist yet?
Let's create it.

Email/Discord me a description of your project so I can see if it's something I can do and whether it fits my schedule.
I can then offer you an estimate.

I offer 2 pricings:

- **Private**: 35CHF for each half hour of work. The full code ownership is transferred to you and you choose how to publish it.
- **Open-source**: 25CHF for each half hour of work. I release the extension under the MIT license on my GitHub account.

Open-source pricing will only be offered at my discretion for work that offers clear community benefits.

Minimum amount of work is 2 hours.
Payment is possible via Paypal, credit card or IBAN.

If the requirements are well defined, I can offer a fixed price instead of hourly.

You can also sponsor additional features or upgrades to existing extensions published by myself or the FriendsOfFlarum initiative.

## General help

I often help people free of charge via [Flarum Discuss](https://discuss.flarum.org/) or the [Flarum Discord](https://flarum.org/discord/).
No need to mention me, other qualified people will help you there as well.

If you're looking for custom guidance on large projects, please get in touch.

## Flarum database migration

Due to my limited availability, the fixed-price migration service is currently on hold.

You can join the waiting list at [migratetoflarum.com](https://migratetoflarum.com/) to get updates about the future automated platform.

If you have a large migration project, you can get in touch to discuss the possibilities.
